## Introduction

The File Utility is in charge to upload files. This proxy the [uploadify](www.uploadify.com) library and use, as reference, the api of the [uploadifive](http://www.uploadify.com/documentation/), but with some differences that it will be explained below.
Basically, it allows to address file upload features transparently to developers, interfacing differents libraries/tools.

## Demo

[View demo](http://www.fileutility.webege.com/)

## Compatibility

Chrome, Firefox, IE10, IE9 and IE8.

## Dependencies

To have a complete user experience you should have jquery.uploadifive.js, jquery.uploadify.js and uploadify.swf. You can get this from the [uploadify website](http://www.uploadify.com/download/). 

The HTML5 version is the paid version, but the FLASH version is free and has the MIT License.

If you can not afford the paid version you can use it only with the FLASH version but you will lose all the features of the HTML5 version. This is up to you.

Note: you can dowload from this repo the FLASH version (jquery.uploadify.js and uploadify.swf).

## How to use

Create an instance of File Utility:

```javascript
	var fileUpload = new fileUtility()
```

Setup the options that follow your file upload needs:

```javascript
var options = {
	'url': 'server.php',
	'buttonText': 'Browse',
	'auto': false,
	'height': 20,   // always set a height 
	'width' : 78,   // always set a width
	'onProgress': function (file, bytesUploaded, bytesTotal){
		//do something
	},
	'onUploadComplete': function (file, data){
		//do something
	},
	'onError': function (errorType, file){
		//do something
	},
	'onUploadFile': function (file){
		//do something
	},
	'onAdd': function (file) {
		//do something
	}
};
```

Initialize fileUtility using an input type file and the options:

```javascript
	// the first arguments always has to be a input type file
	fileUpload.init($(input[type=file]), options);
```

Use methods

```javascript
	fileUpload.upload();
```

Upload files!

## Configuration

## Styling

### Input Styling

For a correct cross browsing styling, wrap the input type file between span and put the css on the span.
For example:
```html
	<span class="btn btn-success">
		<input id="fileupload" type="file"/>
	<span>
```

In this example I used bootstrap classes

### Queue 

If you don't want to see the queue that is a default behavior of this library put this in your css:
```css
	.uploadifive-queue, .uploadify-queue {
		display: none
	}
```
